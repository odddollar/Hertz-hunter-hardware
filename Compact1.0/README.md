### Description

This is an experimental compact version I created based on my full-size design. I'll only test the full-size version, but should work without any issues.

The display is any OLED I2C 0.96 from aliexpress, with the default pinout:
GND VCC SCL SDA
If your display's pinout is VCC GND SCL SDA, you can swap VCC and GND by aligning R3 and R4 horizontally.
